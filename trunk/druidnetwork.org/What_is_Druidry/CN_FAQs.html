<h4><a id="do" title="do" name="do"></a>德鲁伊是做什么的？</h4>
<p>
这是一个很简单的问题，经常被问起，但却很难回答。<br/>
沉浸在神圣的大自然、先祖和传统文化之中的德鲁伊，在实践中需要学习许多方面的知识。<!--貌似译得有些纠结。原文：Revering nature, ancestry and heritage as sacred, the practice of Druidry requires a great deal of dedicated learning.--><br/>
学习大自然：德鲁伊歌颂四季的更替循环，关注人类对于生态环境的影响。他会积极参与到保护地球和保护非人类生命的行动中来。<br/>
学习人的本性：德鲁伊努力提升自我认识，寻求对情绪、理智、意识和自由意志的理解。他会寻找灵感的源泉，培养并发挥他的创造力，努力给社区、村庄或部落带来积极的影响。<br/>
学习先祖的知识：德鲁伊会学习本民族的传统文化和民族历史，并乐于探索先祖的故事、神话和民间传说。许多人还会学习先祖的语言、音乐，以及传承下来的民间故事。在这之中，德鲁伊会发现自己的信仰，并且忠于自己的信仰，承诺让自己有尊严的活着。
</p>
<p>
总之，德鲁伊的生活中没有任何一部分与信仰、先祖或自然完全无关－－生炉子、照料花园、带孩子、看日出……德鲁伊的旅程就是学习如何尊重，如何负责，如何虔诚地去做每件事。
</p>
<h4><a title="word" name="word"></a>“德鲁伊”这个词是什么意思？</h4>
<p>
There are many proposed answers to this question. The most common interpretation looks at the etymologies of, and ancient British words, for 'oak' or 'doorway' in the opening <i>dru</i>, and 'wisdom' in the closing <i>wid</i>. Essentially the word implies somone who is wise in the ways of nature, or what lies within. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a> 
</p>
<h4><a title="religion" name="religion"></a>德鲁伊是一种宗教信仰吗？</h4>
<p>
If we define 'religion' as a spiritual practice that involves devotion, reverence or worship of deity or a divine principal, then the Druid tradition is a religion. 
</p>
<p>
However, because many Druids find the word religion too entangled in associations of hierarchical, dogmatic, liturgically-based monotheism, the word itself is sometimes avoided. The preferred word is often 'spirituality', as this some feel better implies the autonomy and freedom of Druidic religious understanding and expression. Druidry is, nonetheless, a religion. 
</p>
<p>
While The Druid Network engages with people of all faiths and none, the tenets and objectives of its Constitution are based upon Druidry as a religion, ancient and modern. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a> 
</p>
<h4><a title="polytheist" name="polytheist">德鲁伊信仰属于多神崇拜吗？</a></h4>
<p>
No. Druidry has no asserted dogma that tightly defines how to perceive deity, instead allowing each individual to explore and experience their own connection with the divine and the sacred. Indeed, this pluralism is central to Druidry, experience of deity being central to Druidic practice rather than the acceptance of any imposed belief. 
</p>
<p>
The majority of Druids do profess to be polytheistic, however. Their gods express every aspect of existence.  Some are forces of nature that are obvious, such as sun, moon, star, earth, river, rain, corn and mountain.  Some are powers of nature that hold the fabric of existence, such as fertility, love, gravity, death, hunger, fate and regeneration.  And some gods are ancestral forces, powers that guide us as human beings in our relationship with the nonhuman world and with each other, being gods such as those of justice, trade and communication. Some refer to their gods with the names and teachings found in our myths, history and folktales, while others use personal and private names for their gods. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to remember that, even if a Druid does not actively revere a particular deity, he will not dismiss a god as nonexistent.  Polytheistic Druids may choose to nurture relationships with some gods and not with others.  For example, a Druid may focus upon the gods of his own locality, such as the deity of the river that passes through his town, or the sea if he lives on the coast, a local mountain or range of hills, the earth itself if he is particularly dependend upon its fertility, or the gods worshipped by ancestors of that landscape (evident, for example, in locally found RomanoBritish inscriptions).  Many Druids will have very strong relationships with two or three gods, a good working relationship with a dozen or so more, and knowledge a perhaps twenty or thirty beyond that.  A Druid will accept the existence of all gods, even if he knows nothing about them. 
</p>
<p>
The majority of Druids would also call themselves pantheistic.  To the Druid, the word 'nature' is used to define the totality of existence: everything there is, human and nonhuman, upon the earth and into the furthest reaches beyond.  Because Druidry is pluralistic, the word 'universe' tends to be avoided, as it implies there to be a unity or oneness which cannot be proven. Nature, however, describes the <i>wholeness</i>. For the pantheist, this wholeness might be referred to as deity.  
</p>
<p>
Some may consider this wholeness to be the supreme divine principal, the great god, the source or ultimate mystery, and so be practising pantheists; others prefer to revere this wholeness through some of the many gods that are integral to its being, and so be better described as practising polytheists. 
</p>
<h4><a title="animism" name="animism"></a>德鲁伊信仰属于万物有灵论吗？</h4>
<p>
Druidry is essentially an animistic tradition in that Druids consider all aspects of nature to be inspirited or have soul; in other words, every aspect of nature has its own inherent value and purpose.  Some would go further and say that at every layer of nature, from the micro- to the macrocosmic, from the subatomic to the galactic, there is consciousness.  
</p>
<p>
A Druid is likely, then, to acknowledge a tree, river or stone to have spirit, or soul, or consciousness.  This consciousness is as different from human consciousness as a stone's nature is different from human nature.  However, perceiving the stone in this way the Druid recognises its sanctity, its history and its place within the environment.  Animism provides an ethical foundation based upon respecting every aspect of nature in this way. 
</p>
<p>
Another way of understanding animism is to affirm that Druidic religion is not dualistic.  Druids  do not believe there is anything beyond nature: there is no creator god who made the world.  Instead, nature is the creative force, perpetually self-creating, without beginning or end.  Druids acknowledging this creativity in every aspect of nature. 
</p>
<h4><a title="festival" name="festival"></a>德鲁伊有自己的“宗教节日”或纪念活动吗？</h4>
<p>
Druids revere nature and the changing cycle of the year, and their celebrations reflect this. Whether celebrating in groups (known as Groves) or individually, they will honour this ever changing relationship through 'the cycle of the year'. Since the mid twentieth century, this cycle - also known as the wheel of the year - has been made up of eight festivals: Samhain (31 October), Winter Solstice, Imbolc (2 February), Spring Equinox, Beltane (1 May), Summer Solstice, Lammas (1 August) and Autumn Equinox. Of these the Summer Solstice is the most well known to the general public, with its relationship to the celebrations at Stonehenge. Some Druids will only celebrate the seasonal festivals (Samhain, Imbolc, Beltane and Lammas), others focus on the solar festivals (the solstices and equinoxes). In addition some groups may celebrate the cycle of the moon. 
</p>
<p>
For more information on festivals, see our <a href="http://www.druidnetwork.org/en/rites/seasonal/index.html">Rites and Celebrants</a> pages in <a href="http://www.druidnetwork.org/en/practice">Druidry in Practice</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a> 
</p>
<h4><a title="stonehenge" name="stonehenge"></a>在夏至那天，所有德鲁伊都要去巨石阵吗？</h4>
<p>
Druids have had a long history of being connected with Stonehenge at the solar festivals and many feel it to be an important temple. However, because Druids feel too the importance of tribe and locality, those who don't live close to Stonehenge tend to have a less connection with it, if any at all, preferring temples (ancient and modern) closer to home. 
</p>
<p>
Given the huge numbers who now attend this ancient monument at dawn on 21 June each year, very few Druids are present on this date (often less than a few dozen amidst the 20 000 revellers). Many Druid groups have private access to the temple close to the solstice but away from the crowds, giving them the peace and space to meditate with the stones, the ancestors and the sun. 
</p>
<p>
For more information on Stonehenge, see our <a href="http://www.druidnetwork.org/en/sacredsitesl/index.html">Sacred Sites</a> pages in <a href="http://www.druidnetwork.org/en/what">What is Druidry</a>. 
</p>
<h4><a title="whowere" name="whowere"></a>历史上哪些人是德鲁伊？</h4>
<p>
Strictly speaking, when we ask 'who were the Druids', we are speaking of the intellectual caste of 'Celtic' society, what many understand to be preRoman culture of Iron Age Europe, through the first century BCE (before the Common Era or the birth of Christ). Druids were to the Celts what Brahmins were to within Hindu society: the leaders, lawyers, poets, teachers, physicians, artists, and priests of society. In this way, 'Druid' is a functional term, not an ethnic or religious one, albeit within its own cultural context. 
</p>
<p>
Many Druids are not so specific when they look back on the history of their heritage, acknowledging that the priests of that Iron Age society would have held the legacy of their ancestors. Extend Druidry into prehistory, many feel their Druidry roots back simply into the priesthood of ancient Britain and Europe. 
</p>
<h4><a title="howtoday" name="howtoday"></a>现代怎么还会有德鲁伊？</h4>
<p>
No one can trace a birth lineage of Druids from old times to the present, though some try and some maintain documented claims to prove it. 
</p>
<p>
The spirit of the Green World, however, has a life of its own. It surrounds and enfolds us, whether human culture and history are aware of it or not. From time to time this spirit - the spirit of Druidry - breaks in upon the world anew, and expresses itself in new places and new contexts. In this way, contemporary Druids are both new, and old. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a> 
</p>
<h4><a title="women" name="women"></a>女性可以成为德鲁伊吗？在我的印象中，古代的德鲁伊都是一些白胡子老头！</h4>
<p>
<a title="women" name="women"></a>Most of the artwork and poetry we have portraying Druids dates from the Romantic revival of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a time of rampant patriarchy, and therefore women are noticeably absent. 
</p>
<p>
But in the old tales, Celtic women shared status and authority with men. To mention just three who were sorceresses as well as warriors - Scathach in Scotland, who trained the great Irish hero Cuchulain; Boudicca, Queen of the Iceni peoples in south eastern Britain; and Aoife in Ireland, who changed King Lir’s children into swans. 
</p>
<p>
Contemporary Druidry is practised by women and men alike, carrying on its established tradition. The balance is around equal, though on many internet forums it may feel as if there are more men than women posting comments, and in workshops there are often more more women than men present. At public ritual, there is often a more balanced ratio. 
</p>
<h4><a title="interfaith" name="interfaith"></a>德鲁伊对其他宗教的态度是什么？</h4>
<p>
Druids are polytheistic and/or pantheistic, so their attitude is naturally pluralistic, and thus accepting of others' beliefs and ideas. A person's measure is taken by their actions, their generosity, honesty and responsibility, not by the names of the gods they swear by. 
</p>
<p>
For more information on interfaith, see our <a href="http://www.druidnetwork.org/en/interfaith/index.html">Interfaith</a> pages in <a href="http://www.druidnetwork.org/en/practice">Druidry in Practice</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a> 
</p>
<h4><a title="christian" name="christian"></a>德鲁伊可以同时信仰基督教吗？</h4>
<p>
Holding a pluralistic perspective, it is possible that a Druid might find vallue in and respect the teachings of the Christian religion, and its heritage within Britain, including that of the Culdee or Celtic Christian Church.  However, the Druid does not acknowledge deity to be existent outside of Nature, for nothing is beyond Nature: the Druidic understanding is of Nature as All, in a process of perpetual self-creating.  This is not Christianity. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, it is possible for a Christian to respect the teachings of Druidry, and to perceive the whole of Nature as created by his one god, and thus profoundly sacred.  However, the Christian god is supernatural, ie. transcendant of Nature.  This is not Druidry.

</p>
<h4><a title="wicca" name="wicca"></a>巫术崇拜和德鲁伊信仰的区别是什么？</h4>
<p>
This is a complex question that many have spent a good deal of time on, for answers can vary according to the individual practice of those who are responding to the question. If someone has studied a great deal of Wicca before moving into Druidry, their Druidic practice may well reflect that. 
</p>
<p>
The distinguishing features given here may appear generalisations and extremes, but they still hold some validity. 
</p>
<p>
In Wicca, it is common to honour the goddess and her divine consort, while Druids tend to be more polyethistic and animistic. Deity is often acknowledged as most important in Wicca, together with anthropomorphised spirits or entities, while Druidry tends to honour the environment, spirits of place, and the ancestors first. Druidry is very much focused upon Britain and Ireland (with some finding its heritage within other European landscapes), its gods and mythologies being of these islands, while Wicca more readily works with gods from any tradition, land and culture. 
</p>
<p>
Wicca often has a focus on creating change through spell working to improve lives, while the focus in Druidry is inspiration and creativity. In Wicca, the cardinal directions and four elements of earth, air, fire and water, are always key, while in Druidry these can be left out, the focus as often being upon the three worlds of earth, sea and sky. 
</p>
<p>
Wiccan ritual groups (covens) tend to be closed, held in private, and are often fairly secretive; Druid ritual groups (groves) are usually open. Wicca is generally an initiatory tradition and formally taught whereas Druidry is more personal and experiential, its teachings openly accessible. Wiccan ritual is more often held indoors, while Druid ritual is usually held outside. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h4><a title="bardovatedruid" name="bardovatedruid"></a>我需要学习巴德、奥瓦德、德鲁伊的课程，或者其中的一部分吗？</h4>
<p>
Many teachers and teaching groups will give instruction in Druidry moving from one element of the tradition to the next, starting with Bard, moving through Ovate to Druid. Some Welsh and Irish systems include other elements of the tradition. This is thought to be traditional and useful, the student building upon skills one by one. 
</p>
<p>
However, many who have trained long and hard within Druidry, having studied all the levels, find they naturally tend towards the one where they are most skilled. Some don't proceed in training, stopping where they feel comfortable. 
</p>
<p>
Those who don't go through any formal training are as likely to feel they have skills naturally in one area or another, feeling the distinction between the three (or more) roles is not important. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a> 
</p>
<h4><a title="gaelic" name="gaelic"></a>我需要学习古代凯尔特语言吗？</h4>
<p>
Some Druid Orders, Groves or groups do insist that a student learns one of the old Celtic languages - Welsh, Breton, Manx, Irish Gaelic, Cornish or one of the Scottish languages. This is most often true of groups that are either based in the Celtic diaspora, especially Australia and North America, where Druidry is very much a religious tradition of ancestral roots, or of reconstructionist groups in Britain and Ireland. There is certainly often felt a rich benefit can be gained, and a deeper connection to the ancestors made, when we know the language. 
</p>
<p>
There are as many groups who feel it is more important to live honourably and pour time and energy into an immediately relevant skill or task than spend time learning an ancestral language if it is not local to where you are living. 
</p>
<h4><a title="creation" name="creation"></a>有德鲁伊的神话传说吗？</h4>
<p>
The ancient Druids left no written texts of their own of any kind, so our perceptions of their beliefs and mythology have to be made by inference from two sources. The first are the accounts of Greek and Roman writers, who were their contemporaries, albeit often hostile and variably-informed ones. The second is the much later literatures of medieval Wales and Ireland. Both these types of source are extremely problematic and difficult to interpret.<br />
<br />
One topic that is not addressed in either type of source is the issue of creation myths. We have absolutely no idea whatsoever how the ancient druids or Celtic peoples viewed the creation of the Universe, or what deities, spirits, or cosmic processes they may have regarded as responisble for it. This is a disappointing answer, I know, but an honest one. 
</p>
<h4><a title="grandfather" name="grandfather"></a>“我的祖父是德鲁伊，你们有他的会员记录吗？”</h4>
<p>
This is a question that we get asked quite often. The problem is that Druidry is not a unitary body, and there are various organisations that the said grandfather could have been a member of. However, having said that, there are two allied organisations that seem to have been responsible for a good deal of the said grandfathers, and those two organisations now still exist as one body, although on a much smaller scale than was once the case. In England is the Ancient Order of Druids. This was originally set up as a Friendly Society open only to males and operating under pseudo-masonic lines, even so far as the local groups being known as Lodges. Overseas the equivalent Order was the United Ancient Order of Druids and their groups were usually called Groves and they did allow female members their own groups known as Circles. Both these groupings now come under the International Grand Lodge of Druidism and any information that is still available may be sought through them via their <a href="http://www.igld.org/">website</a>. The Ancient Order of Druids in the UK has its own website <a href="http://www.aod-uk.org.uk/">here</a>. However not all of the old local groups returned their records to the national Grand Lodges when they dissolved but it may be possible to obtain information from local record offices in the relevant areas. A list of local repositories can be found <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/bicentenary/bilinks.html">here</a>.

<p>
To many Druids, a fundamental expression of their Druidic practice and perspective is a deep love of the land. Many experience a sense of devotion to the landscape where they live, and/or those that were the homelands of their ancestors. That notion of home reveals an emotional and spiritual connection, inspiring the individual to nurture, protect and care for the land. For some, this is may be no more than a few square miles; more often it is concentrated within twenty or thirty mile radius, but extends beyond that even further. For a good number, this sense of home embraces a huge chunk of land, or the entire island where they live - or their significant ancestors lived.<br />
<br />
When a Druid speaks of this devotion, it is an expression of their connection with the land. Woven into that is the history of the land together with heritage and local culture; in other words what is also important is the way in which the ancestors lived, loved and died, how they learned to engage with the land and each other, where they succeeded and where they failed.<br />
<br />
For someone intent on doing so, and if the boundaries of 'home' happen to co-incide with some current or former political boundary, it could be imagined that the Druid's devotion is a kind of nationalism. It may also be thought that a Druid's reverence for their ancestors (or sense of their presence, and desire to learn from them) is a rejection of other nationalities and cultures, being somehow quietly underpinned by xenophobia. Neither of these are valid understandings of Druidry.<br />
<br />
A Druid's love of home, expressed as devotion to the landscape and ancestors, can more accurately be equated to the love of another person; if we love one person, it does not imply that we think little of others, even less despise them. Druidry teaches us to accept and celebrate the diversity of the wholeness of nature.
