How does a druid communicate with animals? I'm interested in it. Could you shares your experiences or knowledge.
德鲁伊怎么和动物交流？我对此很感兴趣，你们可以分享一下你们的体验或者见解吗？

1# Andrew Smith：

By learning their language :)

学习他们的语言就可以了：）

2# Potia：

Different druids will communicate with animals in different ways.
不同的德鲁伊会用不同的方法与动物交流。

For some it will be spending a lot of time studying and observing the type of animal they are drawn to and slowly forming a relationship with one or two individual animals.
有的是花大量的时间观察和了解一种使他们着迷的动物，并逐渐与其中的一两只建立友好关系。

For others it will be learning to walk in the spirit worlds and learning from an animal spirit.
另一种是学习走入灵性世界，然后向某个动物之灵请教。

Others may use a combination of these techniques or just follow their instincts. As with many things in druidry there are no set methods that work for everyone.
还有人可能同时使用以上两种方法，或者仅仅使用他们的直觉和本能。和其他许多德鲁伊界的事情一样，与动物交流并没有一个固定的适用于所有人的方法。

Communicate is a complex word; I am no Doolittle. It is perhaps a matter of observing, being simple and open, and feeling for an empathic understanding without words. And I am not very good at it at all. :-)
“交流”是一个含义复杂的词；我不是杜利特尔（传说中一个能和动物说话的人，译者注）。和动物交流大概是简单而旷达的——去看，以及去感受——达到一种感情卷入，于是无需语言也能互相理解。但我对这方面一点也不擅长。

Andrew said in his reply that learning the animals language is the way, and I agree with him.
Andrew在他的回复中说方法是学习动物的语言，我同意他的观点。

Different animals have their own way of communicating their needs and feelings to us, and we learn what they are a saying to us when we live with them.
不同的动物有各自不同的方法来向我们表达它们的需求和感觉，当我们和它们生活在一起的时候，我们便能学会它们在“说”什么。

Ask anyone who has dogs or cats for example, and they will always instinctively know what their companion wants.
拿任何一个养狗或养猫的人来说，他们总是能凭直觉知道他们的动物伙伴想要什么。

Watching people inter-acting with animals is fascinating, and I always come away with the feeling that animals know more about us than we do them!
看人与动物互动是一件令人着迷的事，每次结束旁观时我都有这样一种感觉——动物对我们的了解比我们对它们的了解还要多。

I really don't believe it matters whether one is a Druid or not as we can all communicate with them - the more you love them, the more you understand them.
我相信是不是德鲁伊对我们能不能与动物交流是没有影响的，每个人都可以与它们交流——你越爱它们，你越理解它们。

I think it's more to do with good old love than anything else.
我认为，培养那可能有些老套的——发自内心的爱，要远比做其他什么有用得多。

@potia It's interesting. I may have some instincts to an animal but his or her instinct is fleeing from my sight sometimes --.
@pitia 听起来很有趣的样子。有时候我似乎对某些动物有所“直觉”，但是它们的直觉往往是逃离我的视线— —。

And I have only a imagining of the spirit worlds by its name. What are these worlds look like?
还有，我对灵性世界仅仅只有一个字面上的认识，这些世界是什么样的？

It's possible to interpret this question in two ways and I note that both have featured in comments so far.
可以把这个问题一分为二的来看待，而且这两点在之前的回复中都提到了。

Talking directly to bodily present animals like pets, farm animals and even animals in the wild like the robin in my garden is something I suppose we all do with some measure of success perhaps with pets (though I have to admit that my cat seems determined to misunderstand me!).
直接与现实中的动物个体交谈（比如宠物、家禽、家畜，甚至一些野生动物比如花园里的知更鸟），我想就和对我们养了多年的宠物说话一样，我们所有人在某种程度上都能做到。（虽然我必须承认我的猫看上去下定决心要误解我的意思！）

Talking to spirit animals is another matter in path working or spontaneous meditation because the 'language' used is not comprised of words so much as the sort of way things are known or understood in dreams. Developing that language is no different from learning how to walk to spirit paths.
通过刻意或不经意的冥想来实现与动物之灵交谈是另一种方法，因为这种交流使用的“语言”不是用字词组成的，所以它特别像我们在梦中认识和理解事物的方式。发展这种语言无异于学习如何走上灵性的道路。

But inbetween these there is the matter of coming across a spirit animal in the wild. Portents were often read from the appearances of animals in ancient times. Today such portent reading and prophesying is perhaps less common. But as individuals if we have a spirit animal and meet such an animal in the wild decoding the significance (or otherwise) of seeing the animal is often difficult. Are you being told something or did that owl just happen to call from the woodland because that's what owls do? Then you really do have to be able to understrand what the answering call from within you is saying.
但在这其间还有一种情况，即是在野外偶遇一只活着的“动物之灵”。在古代，这常常被看成是一种预兆，在今天还把它们看成是预兆并以此做出预言的也许不常见了。但是作为个人，假如我们有这样一个动物之灵，在野外看到一只这样的动物有着特殊意义或者通常是很困难的。（比如乌鸦或猫头鹰之类的，译者注。）那么，当你听到树林间传来猫头鹰叫声的时候，你是认为它向你说了些什么，还是认为那仅仅是猫头鹰偶然的鸣叫——因为鸣叫是它们本来就会做的事情呢？然后，你就真的必须有能力去理解你发出的回应叫声是在说什么了。

For me with physical animals it's a case of being around them, learning their body language and building a relationship. My strongest relationship has been horses, having ridden since I was six and worked with them on and off since my teens. Although I don't work with horses or own a horse any more I work at a saddlery with an adjoining yard where race horses are kept so still manage to keep a bit of contact. They also frequent my dreams at least a couple of nights a week.

My parents have cats and I've always found their presence comforting, similar with yard dogs.

I am trying really hard to connect more with the wildlife in my locality just by sitting, listeing and watching and being open. I'd say I connect with the blackbirds most strongly- particularly the magic of their song at twilight. I feel a connection with the magpies- that they're both handsome and tricksy but no real understanding. Robin always stands out and I always feel joy when I see wren in the ivy. Squirrels are the one I struggle with the most. They often bark and flick their tail when they see me... not sure if we'll ever get on.

When I first started journeying I expected animals to talk- as if I was in Narnia or something... and to begin with was quite frustrated at my inability to understand what they were saying. They usually have to take me to show me something, or occasionally they will show me an image psychically or a word or phrase will come into my mind but not by ear.
