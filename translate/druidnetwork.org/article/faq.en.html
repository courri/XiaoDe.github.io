<h3>What do Druids do?</h3>
This is an enormously simple question, often asked yet fairly hard to answer. Revering nature, ancestry and heritage as sacred, the practice of Druidry requires a great deal of dedicated learning.

Studying the environment, a Druid will celebrate the cycle of the seasons, becoming involved with ecological work and in the protection of the earth and its nonhuman inhabitant.

Studying human nature, the Druid will work on self-knowledge, seeking understanding of emotions, reason, consciousness and free will. Finding his sources of inspiration, he will nurture and express his creativity to inspire his community or tribe.

Studying his ancestry and that of his people, and the landscapes of his people and his ancestors, he will learn of his heritage, history and pre-history, exploring the stories of his ancestors, mythologies and folklore. Many will learn Celtic or ancestral languages, music, storytelling or oratory.

In all these, the Druid will find his gods, showing his devotion to them with offerings, prayer, creativity and commitment to live honourably.

In other words, there is no part of life where a Druid is not engaging with his gods, his ancestors and the evironment - lighting a fire in the hearth, tending the garden, caring for children, watching the sunrise. The journey of the Druid is to learn how to interact in all things respectfully, responsibly, as an act of devotion.


<h3>What does the word 'Druid' mean?</h3>
There are many proposed answers to this question. The most common interpretation looks at the etymologies of, and ancient British words, for 'oak' or 'doorway' in the opening dru, and 'wisdom' in the closing wid. Essentially the word implies somone who is wise in the ways of nature, or what lies within.

<h3>Is Druidry a religion?</h3>
If we define 'religion' as a spiritual practice that involves devotion, reverence or worship of deity or a divine principal, then the Druid tradition is a religion.

However, because many Druids find the word religion too entangled in associations of hierarchical, dogmatic, liturgically-based monotheism, the word itself is sometimes avoided. The preferred word is often 'spirituality', as this some feel better implies the autonomy and freedom of Druidic religious understanding and expression. Druidry is, nonetheless, a religion.

While The Druid Network engages with people of all faiths and none, the tenets and objectives of its Constitution are based upon Druidry as a religion, ancient and modern.


<h3>Are all Druids polytheistic?</h3>
No. Druidry has no asserted dogma that tightly defines how to perceive deity, instead allowing each individual to explore and experience their own connection with the divine and the sacred. Indeed, this pluralism is central to Druidry, experience of deity being central to Druidic practice rather than the acceptance of any imposed belief.

The majority of Druids do profess to be polytheistic, however. Their gods express every aspect of existence.  Some are forces of nature that are obvious, such as sun, moon, star, earth, river, rain, corn and mountain.  Some are powers of nature that hold the fabric of existence, such as fertility, love, gravity, death, hunger, fate and regeneration.  And some gods are ancestral forces, powers that guide us as human beings in our relationship with the nonhuman world and with each other, being gods such as those of justice, trade and communication. Some refer to their gods with the names and teachings found in our myths, history and folktales, while others use personal and private names for their gods.

It is important to remember that, even if a Druid does not actively revere a particular deity, he will not dismiss a god as nonexistent.  Polytheistic Druids may choose to nurture relationships with some gods and not with others.  For example, a Druid may focus upon the gods of his own locality, such as the deity of the river that passes through his town, or the sea if he lives on the coast, a local mountain or range of hills, the earth itself if he is particularly dependend upon its fertility, or the gods worshipped by ancestors of that landscape (evident, for example, in locally found RomanoBritish inscriptions).  Many Druids will have very strong relationships with two or three gods, a good working relationship with a dozen or so more, and knowledge a perhaps twenty or thirty beyond that.  A Druid will accept the existence of all gods, even if he knows nothing about them.

The majority of Druids would also call themselves pantheistic.  To the Druid, the word 'nature' is used to define the totality of existence: everything there is, human and nonhuman, upon the earth and into the furthest reaches beyond.  Because Druidry is pluralistic, the word 'universe' tends to be avoided, as it implies there to be a unity or oneness which cannot be proven. Nature, however, describes the wholeness. For the pantheist, this wholeness might be referred to as deity. 

Some may consider this wholeness to be the supreme divine principal, the great god, the source or ultimate mystery, and so be practising pantheists; others prefer to revere this wholeness through some of the many gods that are integral to its being, and so be better described as practising polytheists.


<h3>Are all Druids animistic?</h3>
Druidry is essentially an animistic tradition in that Druids consider all aspects of nature to be inspirited or have soul; in other words, every aspect of nature has its own inherent value and purpose.  Some would go further and say that at every layer of nature, from the micro- to the macrocosmic, from the subatomic to the galactic, there is consciousness. 

A Druid is likely, then, to acknowledge a tree, river or stone to have spirit, or soul, or consciousness.  This consciousness is as different from human consciousness as a stone's nature is different from human nature.  However, perceiving the stone in this way the Druid recognises its sanctity, its history and its place within the environment.  Animism provides an ethical foundation based upon respecting every aspect of nature in this way.

Another way of understanding animism is to affirm that Druidic religion is not dualistic.  Druids  do not believe there is anything beyond nature: there is no creator god who made the world.  Instead, nature is the creative force, perpetually self-creating, without beginning or end.  Druids acknowledging this creativity in every aspect of nature.

<h3>What are the Druids’ religious holidays or festivals?</h3>
Druids revere nature and the changing cycle of the year, and their celebrations reflect this. Whether celebrating in groups (known as Groves) or individually, they will honour this ever changing relationship through ‘the cycle of the year’. Since the mid twentieth century, this cycle – also known as the wheel of the year – has been made up of eight festivals: Samhain (31 October), Winter Solstice (21 December), Imbolc (2 February), Spring Equinox (21 March), Beltane (1 May), Summer Solstice ( 21 June), Lammas (1 August) and Autumn Equinox (21 September). Of these the Summer Solstice is the most well known to the general public, with its relationship to the celebrations at Stonehenge. Some Druids will only celebrate the seasonal festivals (Samhain, Imbolc, Beltane and Lammas), others focus on the solar festivals (the solstices and equinoxes). In addition some groups may celebrate the cycle of the moon.
